# Performance simple adn server tests for c, java, javascript (node) and Go.
## Performance tests in several basic scenarios to estimate languages runtime performance

### http
[http server results](/http/readme.md)
perform http request with json or plain-text response

### loop

Running 10000000 loop and performing memory operations while avoding optimization if possible (for example loop unrolling in c)

### read file
[read file test results](/readfile/readme.md)
